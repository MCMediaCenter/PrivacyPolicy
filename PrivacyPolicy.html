        <h1>MC Media Center by mcosmin - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Personal information gathered</h2>
        <span>
            All MC Media Center applications (including Windows Phone 8.1) under various names developed by me (mcosmin) WILL NEVER collect any personal information about its users.
        </span>
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <span>
            I, mcosmin, may respond do your reviews on the Windows Store from the email address mihaicosmin2004@yahoo.com. I may require additional information on what you were doing when the application encountered a problem or what additional features you may want implemented in the app. Any personal information that could be extracted from email exchanges, including files, names, physical addresses will NOT be used by me in any way. Weather you want to contact me back is up to you.
        </span>
        <h2>Proximity & network</h2>
        <h3>
            NFC
        </h3>
        <span>Applications can interact with NFC tags for automatization. This may happen silently, depending on OS settings</span>
        <h3>
            Network interactions
        </h3>
        <span>
            The application can detect other applications running on devices connected to the same wifi network via IP addresses. Users can opt out of network discovery from settings. I will not collect any information about the discovered devices.
        </span>
        <span>
            Devices running the application can send files between each other. Users can always opt out of file transfers completely or filter out files one by one. The application will store a local log of all files transfered and the remote end point. This log is for security purposes of the user and is NEVER uploaded to me in any way. Once the app is uninstalled, the log is gone.
        </span>
        <span>
            The application downloads Bing image of the day every day. This service is needed for the good function of some application features.
        </span>
        <h2>File access</h2>
        <span>
            The application needs access to your music, picture and video files in order to work properly.
        </span>
        <span>
            The application may save files to your disk in the following cases:

        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>When editing metadata tags of music files: it will create a backup file and then save changes to your target file. The backup can be located in your music folder</li>
            <li>When transferring files from other instances: The app will try to recreate the exact folder location of the file as on the other devices, but may fail to do so all the time. Transferred files will always be in your music or video folders</li>
            <li>When creating cue sheets or m3u playlists.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other parties involved</h2>
        <span>I am in no way responsible for what any of the other parties involved may do with information they gather.</span>
        <span>All other parties involved in this contract (such as Microsoft, Yahoo, Bing etc) have their own privacy policy.</span>
        <span>The application can interact with other applications through file picker contracts. Other apps may log or track what files you have been opening.</span>
